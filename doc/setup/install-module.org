install-module.sh [OPTIONS] FROM NM-DIR

Module rooted at =FROM= ( as =FROM/package.json= ), will be installed to
=NM-DIR/<NAME>= symlinking any executables to =NM-DIR/.bin=.

- *-i*,--ident ID :: Treat =ID= as the package identifier/name

- *-b*,--bins :: Force processing of bins

- *-B*,--no-bins :: Skip processing bins

- *-p*,--perms :: Force fixing of =FROM= permissions for dirs and bins

- *-P*,--no-perms :: Skip checking of =FROM= permissions, copy them "as
  is"

- *-s*,--patch :: Force patching shebangs

- *-S*,--no-patch :: Skip patching shebangs

- *-l*,--bin-links :: Force creation of executable symlinks

- *-L*,--no-bin-links :: Skip creation of executable symlinks

- *-u*,--usage :: Print usage message to STDOUT

- *-h*,--help :: Print this message to STDOUT

- *-V*,--version :: Print version to STDOUT

* ENVIRONMENT

#+begin_quote
  The following environment variables may be used unless explicitly
  overridden by options/flags mentioned above. These variables are not
  required, but may be used as an optimization to skip reading the
  contents of =package.json=.

  Variables marked as "Bool" are treated as false when unset or set to
  the empty string, or true for any non-empty value. Flags will always
  take priority over environment variables.

- =IDENT= :: Treat =IDENT= as the package identifier/name.

- =NO_BINS= :: Skip processing of bins if non-empty. ( Bool )

- =BIN_PAIRS= :: Space separated tuples of executables to be installed as:
  =BIN-NAME,REL-PATH BIN-NAME2,REL-PATH...=

- =BIN_DIR= :: Relative path to directory containing scripts to be
  installed as executables ( drops any extension for exposed bin ). This
  variable is ignored if =BIN_PAIRS= is non-empty.

- =NO_BIN_LINKS= :: Skip creation of executable symlinks. ( Bool )

- =NO_PERMS= :: Skip checking/fixup of directory and executable
  permissions when non-empty. ( Bool )

- =NO_PATCH= :: Skip patching shebangs in scripts when non-empty. ( Bool )

- =NODEJS= :: Absolute path to =node= executable. May be omitted if
  patching shebangs is disabled.

- =JQ= :: Absolute path to =jq= executable. May be omitted if =IDENT= is
  known and any =*BIN*= variable is is non-empty ( it is only needed to
  read =package.json= ).

- =ID= :: Absolute path to =id= executable.

- =CHMOD= :: Absolute path to =chmod= executable.

- =CHOWN= :: Absolute path to =chown= executable.

- =MKDIR= :: Absolute path to =mkdir= executable.

- =CP= :: Absolute path to =cp= executable. This is useful for adding
  additional flags or wrapping the program used to copy files.

- =LN= :: Absolute path to =ln= executable.

- =REALPATH= :: Absolute path to =realpath= executable.

- =FIND= :: Absolute path to =find= executable.

- =BASH= :: Absolute path to =bash= executable.
