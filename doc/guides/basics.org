#+TITLE: Getting Started

Let's start out with a simple project with only
registry dependencies and no `install` scripts in
the dependency graph.

Our project will be a simple Typescript CLI tool.
This means we will have a build stage, a `global`
installation target, and a `dist` target ( a tarball
suitable for publishing ).

I want to highlight the fact that our dependency graph
only contains trivial packages that do not require
installations - we will cover handling these dependencies
in another guide.
For now we're keeping things simple.

* Creating the Project
In the spirit of completeness, this guide uses real sources
so that we can automatically detect if it's out of date
and so that you can copy these files to try them on
your box.
