#+TITLE: Getting Started

Let's start out with a simple project with only
registry dependencies and no `install` scripts in
the dependency graph.

Our project will be a simple Typescript CLI tool.
This means we will have a build stage, a `global`
installation target, and a `dist` target ( a tarball
suitable for publishing ).
