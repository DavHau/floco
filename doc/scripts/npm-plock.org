* NAME
npm-plock.sh - manual page for npm-plock.sh 0.1.1

* SYNOPSIS
*floco* /update npm-plock /[/-l LOCK-DIR/] [/-o PDEFS-FILE/] [/--
NPM-FLAGS/...]

* DESCRIPTION
Update a =pdefs.nix= file using a =package-lock.json= v3 provided by
=npm=.

This script will trash any existing =node_modules/= trees, and if a
=package-lock.json= file already exists, it will be updated to use the
v3 schema as a side effect of this script.

* OPTIONS
- *-l*,--lock-dir PATH :: Path to directory containing
  =package[-lock].json=. This directory must contain a =package.json=,
  but need not contain a =package-lock.json=. Defaults to current
  working directory.

- *-o*,--out-file PATH :: Path to write generated =pdef= records.
  Defaults to =<LOCK-DIR>/pdefs.nix=. If the outfile already exists, it
  may be used to optimize translation, and will be backed up to
  =PDEFS-FILE~=.

- *-j*,--json :: Export JSON instead of a Nix expression.

- *--* NPM-FLAGS... :: Used to separate =floco update npm-plock= flags
  from =npm= flags.
